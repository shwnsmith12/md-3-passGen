<h3>Description of Project</h3>
We were tasked with creating a password generator that asked for the following criteria:

GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page

This program created should create a password between 8-128 characters, that defaults to all lower-case letters, but given prompts and input can also add upper-case letters, special characters, and/or numericals. The user should be able to decide all criteria, and a password should be generated that meets all specified criteria sellected.
